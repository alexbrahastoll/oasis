When defining the URIs associated with a resource, it is advisable to use shallow routes instead of deep ones. When showing, updating or deleting a resource belonging to a hierarchy it is always possible to have URIs that only require the identifier of the resource being manipulated (instead of also requiring the identifier of the parent resource). There are two advantages in following this practice: easy of usage by developers consuming the API (since they do not have to worry about also having or retrieving the ID of the parent resource) and diminished exposure to security issues related to resource hierarchies in URIs.
