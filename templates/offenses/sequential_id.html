Although a very common practice, the usage of sequential integers for identifying resources can be problematic. From a security standpoint, it is easier for an attacker to guess and try to get a hold of a resource to which the attacker should not have access to (e.g. if the ID of an order is 10, maybe there is a valid order with 9 as its ID). From a business perspective, it is possible for a competitor to monitor one’s operations and to estimate one’s size (e.g. if one makes a purchase every week and calculates how much bigger the IDs get, one can make an estimation on how many products are sold per week). By using Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID), one can solve both aforementioned issues.
